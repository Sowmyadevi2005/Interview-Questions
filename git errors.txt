1. Warning : LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it.
The default value for core.autocrlf is selected during Git installation and stored in system-wide gitconfig 
(\Program Files\Git\etc\gitconfig on Windows, /etc/gitconfig on Linux). Also there are (cascading in the following order):
   – "global" (per-user) gitconfig located at ~/.gitconfig, yet another
   – "global" (per-user) gitconfig at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config or $HOME/.config/git/config and
   – "local" (per-repo) gitconfig at .git/config in the working directory.

So, write git config core.autocrlf in the working directory to check the currently used value and

   – git config --system core.autocrlf false            # per-system solution
   – git config --global core.autocrlf false            # per-user solution
   – git config --local core.autocrlf false              # per-project solution
   


2. Author identity unknown
*** Please tell me who you are.
Run
  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
to set your account's default identity.
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.
fatal: unable to auto-detect email address (got 'Sowmya@Sowmya.(none)')
